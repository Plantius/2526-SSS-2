{p["stars_count"]}

Description:
Due to unsafe usage of `path.join`, https://github.com/{p["project_name"]} is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion vulnerability.
You can read more about this vulnerability and its side effects here: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html

The vulnerable code is at .{gh_url_to_path(p["file_github_url"])} file, which you can access online via: {p["file_github_url"]}
If any of `path.join` arguments is a relative path to the parent directory (../), the returned path can be outside the intended directory and this might lead to leakage of sensitive files.

Running the project:
{format_run_method(p["file_github_url"], p["run_method"])}

Verified proof-of-concept(poc) to read passwd file(Path traversal vulnerability):
```bash
curl --path-as-is server_address:port/{p["poc"].replace("flag.txt", "etc/passwd")}
```

{format_dos(p["is_vulnerable_to_dos"])}

By default, running the vulnerable file opens a port in the {"localhost only" if str(p["is_local"]) == "1" else "network"} scope. Thus the Attack Vector (AV) of CVSS is: {format_network(p["is_local"])}

Impact:
We've calculated the base score of the vulnerability as {p["base_score"]:,.2}, with a severity of "{p["severity"]}" using following the following vector_string: {p["vector_string"]}
You can view the CVSS score online via: https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#{p["vector_string"]}


Mitigation:
We also prepared a patch, which we believe is secure against this attack. Patch file content:
```
{open(f"patches/{p['id']}.patch").read()}
```

You can apply the patch by using the `patch` command:
```bash
patch --fuzz=3 --ignore-whitespace --verbose ".{os.path.dirname(gh_url_to_path(p["file_github_url"]))}" -i patchfile.patch
```

This patch is generated with the help of AI, we verified it's working but still we recommend you verify that it correctly mitigates the bug and doesn't hurt the functionality of your software.
